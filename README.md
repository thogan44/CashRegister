# Cash Register

## The Problem
Creative Cash Draw Solutions is a client who wants to provide something different for the cashiers who use their system. The function of the application is to tell the cashier how much change is owed, and what denominations should be used. In most cases the app should return the minimum amount of physical change, but the client would like to add a twist. If the "owed" amount is divisible by 3, the app should randomly generate the change denominations (but the math still needs to be right :))

Please write a program which accomplishes the clients goals. The program should:

1. Accept a flat file as input
	1. Each line will contain the amount owed and the amount paid separated by a comma (for example: 2.13,3.00)
	2. Expect that there will be multiple lines
2. Output the change the cashier should return to the customer
	1. The return string should look like: 1 dollar,2 quarters,1 nickel, etc ...
	2. Each new line in the input file should be a new line in the output file

## Sample Input
2.12,3.00

1.97,2.00

3.33,5.00

## Sample Output
3 quarters,1 dime,3 pennies

3 pennies

1 dollar,1 quarter,6 nickels,12 pennies

*Remember the last one is random

## Things To Consider
Here are a couple of thoughts about the domain that could influence your response:

* What might happen if the client needs to change the random divisor?
basically would contact me so that I can make the change to the number that is after the modulus
* What might happen if the client needs to add another special case (like the random twist)?
They would contact me so that I would get the requirements and to add a new function to the Moneys object.
* What might happen if sales closes a new client in France?
I would need to add the new denominations to whatever they may be.

I will add an explanation of my project. I approached this on the possibility that this needs to be demo-ed so I used MVC. It is easy as well as the logic is easily transferred to bigger solutions such as an api and perhaps a front end but it is pretty basic and can be easily moved.



So given that it is an MVC project just start it from the sln file it should start from there. Just click the iis button from the start up ui in Visual Studio.
